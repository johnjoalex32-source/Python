# GROCERY BILLING QUEUE
# ===================================

print("=== Grocery Billing Queue ===\n")

# --------------- PART 1: the five counters ------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# Three counters for the price bands: low_price_items, medium_price_items,
# Two more for the day: customers_served and total_sales - both start at 0.
# Also make a variable billing = True to control the outer loop.


# ------------------------ PART 2: the OUTER while loop - one customer per repeat --------------------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# while billing:
#     ask for the customer´s name
#     ask how many items they are buying, wrapped in int()


# ------------------------ PART 3: continue on a bed item count -------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# Still inside the outer loop, before anything else happens:
# if the item count is 0 or less, print a message and use continue.


# ------------------------ PART 4: the INNER while loop - one item per repeat --------------------------
#  YOUR CODE HERE
# Set customer_total = 0 and item_number = 1 first.
# Then: while item_number <= item_count:
#           ask for item name, price, quantity
#           (price and quantiity wrapped in int())


# ------------------------- PART 5: item total and price band -----------------------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# Inside the inner loop:
#  if price or quantity is 0 or less -> print a message and continue
#  print the line:    item_name: quantity x price = item_name:
#  add item_total to customer_total
#  add quantity to the right band: under 50 = low, 50 = low, 50 to 100 = medium, over 100 = high
#  add 1 to item_number      <- forget this and the loop never ends


# -------------------------- PART 6: finish the customer, ask about the next -----------------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# Back out in the outer loop, after the inner loop has finished:
#  add 1 to customers_served, add customer_served, add customer_total to total_sales
#  print the customer´s total
#  ask "Next customer? (yes/no): "
#  if the answer is not yes, set billing = False


# -------------------------- PART 7: the NESTED for report -------------------------
# YOUR CODE HERE
# After the outer loop has ended:
# After the outer for loop has ended:
#  an outer for loop over the three bands
#  an inner for loop printing one * per item in that band, using end=""
# Then print customers_served and total_sales.
